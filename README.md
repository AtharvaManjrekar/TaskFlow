✅ TaskFlow — A Smart To-Do Manager

TaskFlow is my first full-fledged working project, designed to help users organize, manage, and track their daily tasks efficiently.
Although it’s not a completely self-built full-stack application, it uses Firebase for authentication and storage, making it a fully functional and user-ready web app.

🚀 Features

🔐 User Authentication — Secure login and signup with Firebase Authentication.

🧾 Personalized Task Management — Each user can create, view, update, and delete their own tasks.

📊 Individual Task Tracking — Monitor task progress and completion status.

⚡ Real-Time Updates — Instant reflection of changes using Firebase’s real-time database.

🎨 Modern, Minimal UI — A clean, intuitive interface with responsive design for all devices.
